8/23/2023- I drove. I worked with Leah to play with the Google maps api. We looked through old projects people did on gitlab to see examples of how the api could be implemented in our projects. We began trying to use the api in our routers view function and that is what I will be continuing to do today.
    Ellie- Worked on database and was trying to work with cascades. Tried out mongodb triggers and is still trying to finalize that. Also worked on frontend design drafts/wireframes. Goals for today is to continue working on the database.
    Jean- Yesterday he was working on integrating the email api. He was able to get it working and running this morning. He is not able to complete it fully until later in the project. He will continue working with emails today.
    Jonh- Yesterday he finished the logout feature. Is now working with the signup. He is now having issues that login stays out when you click signup. He is working on getting that to work and the plan is to have that working by end of day.
    Leah- Worked with me on the Places api. Watched tutorials and read documentation to understand what we learned yesterday so we can use it today. Also went through the react google maps library. Feels comfortable with it. Today will implement what we found with it.
8/29/2023 - I drove. I worked with Leah to test the Geocode API. I debugged the functions all yesterday and was trying to figure out why it wouldn't return what we were looking for. I then found that the GEOJSON model wasn't returning a dictionary and was actually returning None. We got rid of that model and reworked the APIMapsLocation model and then the tests we successful. Today I plan on working and debugging the nearbysearch function and testing the location creation. No blocker right now.
    John - Working on accounts so that the account can have more than email and password for an account. Also worked on an account update. Today he plans on working on password reset. No blockers right now.
    Ellie - Yesterday she spent time on merge requests. Figured out and worked on how the database will work with the emails. Got a successful response with the email API. Worked on frontend design elements and researched react elements. Going to continue working of user dashboard elements. Wants to have a discussion on forms with team members and allocate that responsibility. No blockers, just updating the database changes.
    Jean - Yesterday he worked on implementing the rsvp headline for the email service. Also he updated the email model. He will continue working on updating the email model. No blockers.
    Leah - Recloned her repo because her repo was off the path. That blocker is now gone. She will work on nearby serach today.
