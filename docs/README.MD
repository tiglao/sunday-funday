**Sunday Funday** is for those party planners who want every guest to leave with a story to tell. Whether it's a chill night out or a wild adventure with pals, our app makes sure everyone's vibe is taken into account. With a touch of collaboration magic, hosts and attendees can together whip up an evening that's the talk of the town.

## Functionality

**Open for All**: No account? No problem. Everyone can create or respond to party plans.

**Profile Perks**: Hop in and set up your own profile. From there, itâ€™s easy-peasy to manage passwords and customize settings.

**Stay Connected**: Plan your party with style! Touch base with your invitees, brainstorm, and while you're at it, let us know how we're doing with some feedback.

**Crafting the Perfect Event**:

- Dive deep with Google Maps API. Just punch in those keywords, and weâ€™ll scout the best spots for you.

- Fancy a spot? Mark it as a favorite and build that dream event list.

- Lay it all out visually. Every venue, whether it's a favorite or a new suggestion, can be seen on our sleek Google Map.

- When things are looking just right, seal the deal. Share with invitees, lock in that plan, and send out the finalized details.

**For the Invitees**:

- A personal touch for every invitee. Check out invites and RSVP your way â€“ thumbs up or down.

- Feel free to chime in. Maybe later down the road, you can suggest some killer venues to the shared map.

**Level Up with Extras**:

- How about a smart itinerary? We're thinking Google Maps could guide the way.

- Got the plan down? Why not book or snag tickets straight from trusted names like OpenTable or Yelp.

- Go a step further, and pencil in specific events with help from platforms like the Yelp API.

**Interact & Explore**: Our event form isnâ€™t just any form. With Google Maps API in the mix, you can sift through venues by what catches your eye or fits the vibe you're going for.

**Sunday Funday** at its core? Making your planning game strong, interactive, and yep, a whole lot of fun!
